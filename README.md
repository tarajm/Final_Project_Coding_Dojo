# Final_Project_Coding_Dojo
Full-Stack Application (Flask, Python, MySQL, Jinja, HTML, CSS, and APIs)

What was your motivation?
This project was created to help neighbors communicate information with each other in a seamless way.  Whether it’s sharing a “lost dog” post with others, or inviting the neighborhood to enjoy a BBQ, Neighborhood Chats allows the user to connect and share information with others.
    
    
Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I was fortunate enough to build this project with two other classmates during our final month at Coding Dojo. We created this project because it allowed us to fully demonstrate the skill-set we developed over the last 6 months and it also allowed us to explore new tools, like APIs.
    
What did you learn?
As a group, we learned a lot about API’s.  In this project we employed the use of a Map and Weather API.  What we learned quickly is that API’s are unique onto themselves.  Meaning, how you sign-up, gather the pertinent API information, and deploy within your IDE can be a unique challenge.   However, we are all better for the experience and happy to report that are API integration into this project is complete.
    
What makes your project stand out?
2 API’s that have been implemented
Responsive CSS that has been used.  (Hover features on buttons and text)

It is simple app, but an app that allows each of us that worked on the project an opportunity to add more.  For example, there is an opportunity to add a many-to-many table on any given Event listing and the opportunity to eventually upload a “Profile Picture” to the User Page.
